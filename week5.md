Q: Briefly describe the libraries Express, Sequelize, React and Redux, and the role each plays in the stack.

A: Express is a framework for handling HTTP requests and responses. It organizes the way our server handles requests for html, css and js files, as well as data from our database. Sequelize is an ORM that allows us to query a database (in our case, a Postgres database) in an object-oriented way. We use Sequelize to define our database tables, and to construct queries. React is a front-end library for writing user interfaces. We use it as an abstraction for dynamically manipulating the DOM in a declarative, functional way. Redux is a state management library. We use it alongside React to handle important bits of state that are needed throughout the app.
